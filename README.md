# fastSlam
FastSLAM 1 and FastSLAM 2 for an autonomous race car using preprocessed Lidar point cloud as input and IMU+wheel encoders for odometry. The python script EKF_odometry2 is used to fuse the SLAM state estimation, IMU and wheel encoders and is then inputted into the SLAM as odometry data for the prediction step.

Everything is described here:
